PyClassic documentation
=======================

This is the official documentation for PyClassic. If you see this, you
are one of the lucky ones that have access to it as it is private to
prevent script kiddies (and chromies) from using it.

.. note::

   This project is in heavy development. A lot of changes may occur.
